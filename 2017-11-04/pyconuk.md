4 days in Cardiff, the land of my people (I'm ¬º Welsh).

Every conference has talks, workshops, keynotes.
What makes a conference stand out is the other things.
PyCon UK stands out in its inclusivity,
its commitment to diversity, and its welcoming atmosphere.

## Affordances

There are deliberate affordances that
help to make it easier for traditionally under-represented
groups to attend,
and to feel welcome when attending:

A professionally staffed creche (at no additional charge):

A quiet room:

A [Code of Conduct](http://2017.pyconuk.org/code-of-conduct/).
Here is [Sasha](https://www.mxsasha.eu/) talking about that
Code of Conduct:

I think the quiet room is particularly effective.
Conferences are busy, noisy, stressful, full of people,
confusing, unfamiliar places.
There are many people that would find
any of those factors a problem;
in combination it can be simply unacceptable.
The availability of a quiet room lets people know
that there is a place they can go if they feel unable
to cope with the rigours of the crowded hallway or auditorium.
An escape valve.

This doesn't happen accidentally.
It is down to the hard thoughtful considerate work of
the committee:

This is just a small selection of
[the concrete actions the committee takes to include people](http://2017.pyconuk.org/diversity-accessibility-inclusion/).

## Children's day

Saturday is Children's day where as well as
the traditional conference there are activities
particularly aimed at children.

They experiment with [micro:bit](http://microbit.org/)‚Ä¶

then at the end of the day, everyone piles in to the main hall to
see Cat Lamin host the children's show-and-tell.
It is quite magical.
These three young people made a Python out of pipe-cleaners
with blinking LED lights.
You can see their python code projected behind them.

## The other talks

There is a quite a variety of talks,
not necessarily about Python.

Chad talking about mental health in the workplace:

And, all the way from India,
[Anweshar](https://anweshadas.in/) and Kushal Das
talking about community building in India.
Anweshar is rolling her eyes as she explains how this man,
now her husband, was trying to impress her when they first met
by talking about Python.

It was fun, and it was good.
All good things must come to an end,
and so did PyCon UK.
I felt a little sad leaving,
but Rae Knowler stepped in to forward some advice from Ash
McAllan.
