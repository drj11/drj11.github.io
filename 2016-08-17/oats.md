[Eurostat](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) is great.

[svg.charts](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/svg.charts) is great.

Between them I've made this chart comparing the oat
production of various countries:

![Oat production and area](../image/C1410.production.svg "Oat production and area")

(Go Poland!) Eurostat covers the EU countries
but also various related territories.
Countries like the potential applicant, Turkey, TR,
and the disputed territory of Kosovo, XK.

The broad picture is clear, the larger an area, the more oats.
But some countries are clearly better than others.
Finland, FI, produces more oats than Spain, ES, using about 25%
less land.
Romania, RO, produces less than half the oats of
the United Kingdom, UK, but uses nearly twice as much land to do so!
