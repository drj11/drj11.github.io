Brutalism in architecture, derived from the French <em>brut</em>
for <em>raw</em>, has the idea that structure should be exposed.
So it is with web design.

<a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Websites like this</a>
are a satire.
But it is a satirical reaction to a real thing.

Obese websites.

<a href="http://brutalistwebsites.com/">Someone has started a
collection of brutalist websites</a>.
The movement is small,
many may not recognise themselves as participating.
Some would call these minimalist rather than brutalist.
Some would call them brutal.

## Inspiring Brutal

Inspired by

- Brutalism; and,
- The wave of "static site generators", Jekyll, Nikola, &c; and,
- Despicable dependencies (Nikola requires a C compiler, wtf!?)â€¦

I created [brutal](https://github.com/drj11/brutal).
It's too stupid to do anything clever,
but it does convert `markdown` to `HTML`.
Mostly relying on the 3rd party Python library
[Markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown).
