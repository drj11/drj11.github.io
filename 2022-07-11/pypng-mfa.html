<h1>PyPNG and the multiple factor authentication</h1>
<time>2022-07-11</time>
<address>by David Jones</address>
<p>I am maintainer of the obscure and only slightly useful
<a href="https://gitlab.com/drj11/pypng">PyPNG package</a>.</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install pypng
# For greater good.
</code></pre>
<p>It's a pure Python implementation of a PNG library.
It can read and write PNG files.</p>
<p>What's wrong with Pillow? ImageMagick? Is there something odd about a
pure-Python version?</p>
<p>From <em>it's very concept</em> the purpose of PyPNG is anti-package.
You like compiling binary dependencies? Use Pillow.
You wan't to link to 3rd party C code? Use <code>libpng</code>.</p>
<p>It is so anti-package that it didn't even use <code>setuptools</code>,
because… <code>setuptools</code> was a 3rd party dependency and i didn't want
any of them.
<code>distutils</code> is dead. Long live <code>distutils</code>.
(you get a lot of funny looks when say you don't depend on
<code>setuptools</code>)</p>
<p>The above is a bit of background to… an e-mail i got.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations! A project you ('drj') maintain has been designated as a critical project on PyPI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh great. Apparently i will</p>
<blockquote>
<p>be required to enable two-factor authentication on their account</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, in the grand scheme of things, fine. whatever.</p>
<h2>What annoys me?</h2>
<p>Timing. 18:17 (UK time), Friday evening.
I'm logged off.
And I won't get to write my grumpy blog post until Monday.</p>
<p>No background, justification, from a noreply account, no-one to reach
out to.</p>
<p>No consultation.</p>
<h2>Maximum Python Man</h2>
<p>(they are always a man)</p>
<p>I am not the Maximum Python Man,
but i pay my dues
(literally, i'm a paying member of PSF (currently <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/donations/">480 on the
roll</a>) and usually of PyCon UK),
i vote (mostly),
i go to PyCon UK when i can and it's not infectious.
I have even given talks and help my buddies with their workshops.
I follow enough Python people that i usually hear about most things.</p>
<p>Maybe if you're Senior Python Fellow in charge of
making sure JP Morgan write another cheque and
PyPI is your world then this is a pretty big deal and
its benefits seem obvious and ineluctable.</p>
<p>I pretty much login in to PyPI only when i update PyPNG and that's
every 7 months on average.
I have no idea what my password is so if my browser doesn't know,
i'll reset via e-mail (this isn't a bad thing, i treat a lot of
websites that way).
If i have a new computer since my last upload or my API key is
missing for some other reason, i'll generate a new one.</p>
<p>I have 2FA in my life, for fairly important things.
Like e-mail, and my NHS records.</p>
<p>But PyPI? I use 3 different web-accessible version control systems, and
you're less important than those.</p>
<p>I woudn't be surprised if i make one more PyPI release and then tell
people to <code>pip install</code> from gitlab after that.</p>
