<h1>Why I donate to Arts Emergency</h1>

<p>The horror we face, of war, poverty, genocide, displacement.
The struggle.</p>

<p>In this crisis of despair, how do we cope?</p>
<p>The arts and humanities are how we appreciate what it is to be human.</p>
<p>They are how we recognise the humanity in each other,
and ultimately, in ourselves.
<em>Violence against one, is violence against all</em>.</p>
<p>The clue is in the name, <em>humanities</em>.</p>
<p>In poetry and dance and stories, and a thousand other ways,
we inspire, aspire, dream, and hope.</p>
<p>It is not the job of The Arts to document,
a simple automaton can do that.
It's the job of The Arts to take what is there, and show what is not.</p>
<p>That's why I help fund <a href="http://www.arts-emergency.org/">Arts Emergency</a>.</p>
