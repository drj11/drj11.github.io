This is very much a personal reflection,
inspired by http://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/foot-candles/

Unlike Alice I took a fairly traditional route
into Computer Science and programming roles:
I did an undergraduate maths degree (3 years) and a
post-graduate diploma in computer science (1 year).

The diploma was marketed as a conversion course,
and was a sort-of rapid pace version of the 3-year undergraduate
course.

From memory we did:

ML, C, Modula-3, Prolog, PostScript, MIPS DEC assembly;

Data Structures & Algorithms;
Databases, Operating Systems;
Numerical Methods;

Graphics, Artificial Intelligence;

Networking, Computer Architecture, Hardware Organisation;

Regular Languages and Automota, Complexity, Computability;

Ethics, Formal Verification;

There was also some sort of business / industry track
which was often invited speakers talking about their business
or how to start one.

Lots of these courses came in "introduction" and "further"
versions.

If you want to consider yourself as having a Computer Science
education, what should it look like?

The short version of this article is that I think most of those
courses are relevant and necessary, but for an absolutely
minimal version they could all be a shorter.

I think you need to be exposed to
more than one computer programming language.
I think ML, which I admit has weaknesses as well as strengths,
is a good choice for this sort of course because:
a) not likely to be encountered before,
so will immediately become an additional string to your bow;
and, b) functional programming is the kind of intellectual
pursuit that "having an education" is supposed to imply.

Knowing more than one programming languages can enable you to
compare and contrast languages,
and it's really the minimum that you need
in order to explore the notion that
different languages might be best for different things.
