# Departmental Ethics Review

I decided I should try and become a departmental ethics reviewer.

It turns out that there isn't really any application process,
you just ask.

Nonetheless when I asked to write a few sentences,
it turned into a longer Personal Statement.

I'm recording it here in my blog because
although written in a hurry it summarises some of
my reflections over the past few years.

I am a software engineer in the Research Software Engineering
group at The University of Sheffield.
My expertise as I see it relating to ethics review is:

- an understanding of large scale computation on large scale data;
- an understanding of encryption technologies
  for data at rest and in flight;
- practical experience of both demonstrating de-anonymisation in
  large datasets and defending against de-anonymisation attacks
  in large datasets;
- practical experience at handling potentially sensitive
  personal data in the context of a small web-based platform
  provider;
- many years' experience in the commercial sector of handling
  commercially sensitive data and the associated paperwork;
- some understanding in the particulars of the terms of service
  for common web platforms (like AWS, github, Twitter), and in
  general the kinds of things that platform providers try to
  enable and limit in their terms of service, and how those
  might impact data processing undertaken both on- and
  off-platform;
- a hobbyist understanding of GDPR, Investigatory Powers Act,
  and similar leglislation.

My personal and professional interests are varied:

Areas where potential participants are uninformed,
only partially informed, or have limited agency
to act once informed.
Examples would be the National Student Survey which is
voluntary, but everyone in the chain is encouraged to meet
particular targets; or, large genomic studies where participants
will not have the necessary scientific training to be fully
aware of what it possible with the data that has been collected.

Areas where the long-term storage of data may may lead to
adversarial secondary re-uses of data
far beyond the scope of the original collection.
An example is that Staff Survey data may be exfiltrated by a
rogue actor or simply demanded by Home Office personnel who
have been freed from the shackles of democratic oversight;
this exfiltrated data may then be used to identify minority or
ethnic groups according to the whims of the rogue actors.

I am also concerned about problems where uneven data landscapes
privilege or harm certain groups more than others.
This can be either through data availability, data processing,
or researcher focus.
An example would be how in genomic studies data from
minority ethnic groups may be discarded in early processing steps
as being an outlier, leading to advances in medical research
being mostly applicable to people of white european ancestry.
Another example might be that people with accessibility needs or
caring responsibilities might not have the time to take on
additional work-related responsibilities such as ethical review,
resulting in the pool of ethical reviewers being diluted in diversity
and enriched with people of privilege.
