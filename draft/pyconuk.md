[brutal]: #title "PyCon UK 2017"
[brutal]: #author "David Jones"

4 days in Cardiff, the land of my people (I'm Â¼ Welsh).

Every conference has talks, workshops, keynotes.
What makes a conference stand out is the other things.
PyCon UK stands out in it's inclusivity,
it's commitment to diversity, and it's welcoming atmosphere.

## Affordances

A professionally staffed creche (at no additional charge):

A quiet room:

A [Code of Conduct](http://2017.pyconuk.org/code-of-conduct/).
Here is [Sasha](https://www.mxsasha.eu/) talking about that
Code of Conduct:

All of these (and [there are
more](http://2017.pyconuk.org/diversity-accessibility-inclusion/)!)
help to make it easier for traditionally under-represented
groups to attend,
and to feel welcome when attending.

I think the quiet room is particularly effective.
Conferences are busy, noisy, stressful, full of people,
confusing, unfamiliar places.
There are many people that would find
any of those factors a problem;
in combination it can be simply unacceptable.
The availability of a quiet room lets people know
that there is a place they can go if they feel unable
to cope with the rigours of the crowded hallway or auditorium.
An escape valve.

This doesn't happen accidentally.
It is down to the hard thoughtful considerate work of
the committee:
