<h1>C A Reference Manual</h1>
<time>2017-07-11</time>
<address>by David Jones</address>
<p>Prompted by conversations with @samathy and Matthew Hughes
I am writing a review of a book about C.</p>
<p>Harbison and Steele's «C A Reference Manual».
The book is a classic and has been revised many times.
In this case I'm reviewing the fifth edition, published in 2002
(this appears to be the most recent edition,
but it is also mostly because that's what was available
The University of Sheffield library stocks).</p>
<h2>Harbison and Steele is good</h2>
<p>Because this review is bound to say lots of negative and
nitpicky things
I'm going to open by saying that
this is a good book and I recommend it.
It is not a good book for beginners;
the reference manual style leaves little room for
gently easing you into difficult topics
or expanding upon subtle ones.
But if you can write a program in C then
this book would make an excellent choice.</p>
<p>Good books on C are rare, and this is a good book.
The authors know they're stuff,
and while they are not always as clear as possible on some topics,
they are assiduous and correct.</p>
<h2>Of course it could be better</h2>
<p>My chief criticisms of the book are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the order;</li>
<li>the examples;</li>
<li>too much focus on pre Standard C</li>
<li>not enough focus on C99 topics: <code>restrict</code> and <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> and
  designated initialisers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Well out of order</h2>
<p>The order of the book roughly follows the order of the C standard.</p>
<p>Practically, this means
the most abstruse and technical parts of C are covered first.
And I mean really obscure.
Like how preprocessor token concatenation used to work
before ANSI came along and standardised it.
This particular topic, of token pasting, allows me to briefly
preview two of other gripes: The examples chosen to illustrate
various language features; and, too much focus on pre-Standard C.</p>
<p>For token pasting,
the authors have an example of how it used to be done,
before Standard C.
Maybe in 1990 it would be useful to have a compare-and-contrast
between Traditional C and Standard C,
but this edition was published in 2002,
12 years after the first Standard for the C programming language
was published.
The example in this case is an example of how not to do it,
and it just clutters the book.</p>
<p>This ordering problem manifests most obviously in the fact that
<code>main()</code>, which is the only function that a (hosted) C program
<em>must</em> provide and which defines the entry point to a C program,
doesn't appear until page 303.
Which is well after halfway in this 533 page book
(generously counting the appendices and the indexes).
For comparison, it's page 6 in Kernighan and Ritchie's even more
venerable classic «The C Programming Language».</p>
<p>Whilst reading I made a note that page 259,
which is the start of Chapter 8, «Statements»,
"would be a great place to start".
And it would be.
Statements are a fairly basic thing in C.
Every C programmer will already be familiar with them
(we're talking things like <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>return</code>),
and this would make a great topic to take
a programmer's practical knowledge of statements
and extend it with some grounded theory and solid reference material.</p>
<p>It's a reference work, I get that.
But even so, I think the order of the material is poor.
At times it's brutally rude (for example, to see an explanation
of the rules of pointer type compatibility before you see the
syntax for pointer expressions).
Other times it is merely capricious.</p>
<h2>Setting a bad example</h2>
<p>As hinted at previously,
many of the examples are examples of how not to do things
(in that they show techniques that are either obscure
or invoke undefined behaviour),
or they are examples that apply to Traditional C
(either "how we did it in the old days" or
"why this traditional technique no longer works").</p>
<p>An example of this, chosen more or less at random,
is on page 212 after the discussion of array notation
there is a program that flattens a 2-dimensional array.
It does this by casting
an array (<code>double matrix[SIZE][SIZE]</code>) to
a pointer (<code>(double *)matrix</code>) so that they can show
their "trick" of using a single loop.
It's bad code.
It's an obscure and unclear trick introduced
because the authors were too weak
to avoid the siren call of premature performance optimisation.</p>
<p>(the bizarre thing is at some level the authors know this,
they frequently signal the code with
"avoid in most situations" or
"you will rarely have good reason to do this")</p>
<p>If you have a copy of the book,
the stand-out example is on page 276 at the end of section 8.7 on
the <code>switch</code> statement.
It is too horrible to repeat here.
Needless to say,
it would make a great example of how not to interview
candidate C programmers.</p>
<h2>Ancient C</h2>
<p>They call it "Traditional C", I call it ancient.
It's the C we programmed before Standard C was published.
In 1990.
Actually a lot of it predates even that period.
Even before Standard C was published
a lot of compiler vendors were moving towards a C
that was more like Standard C
(partly because the vendors were basing their
compiler implementations on draft standards,
but also because the standard was standardising existing
common behavour of implementations).
So there was a light before the dawn.
Admittedly, there were also clouds after the dawn,
vendors dragging their heels and support for older systems
meant that we were still discussing in 1995
if we should write C for "pre ANSI" compilers)</p>
<p>In 2002 (when this edition was published)
we should have been proposing that
programmers start using <code>restrict</code> a bit more,
not persuading them to use prototype function declarations.</p>
<p>Protoype function declarations are ones that include the type of
the formal arguments inside the parentheses:</p>
<pre><code>int floor(float x)
</code></pre>
<p>as opposed to old-style "K &amp; R" definitions:</p>
<pre><code>int floor(x)
float x ;
{ ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Prototype were standardised in 1990, but
the old-style definitions were already old in 1990,
since many compilers had already been supporting
the Standard C prototype syntax.
In 2002, it just seems bizarre.</p>
<p>So I don't really want to see (on page 286) "whether to use
prototypes in C programs is a tricky portability issue".
It's not.
Use prototypes.</p>
<p>There is a quite a lot of discussion of Traditional C in the book,
and I'd rather it were just removed.
You can always refer readers to earlier editions of the book if
they really have to maintain code that uses Traditional C
features.</p>
<h2>C1999</h2>
<p>On the flip side the coverage of
the language changes
introduced with the 1999 version of the C Standard are
most welcome.
But.
But there isn't enough discussion of them.</p>
<p>I've already mentioned <code>restrict</code>
and it's quite a major new feature ("new" as in "new in 1999")
of the language.
It grants to C what every Fortran programmer already had,
the ability to declare that
the output array of a function
is separate (in terms of memory layout)
from the input array of a function.
It's perfect for large matrix multiplies,
because it means that the function implementing them can,
as long as it computes a reasonable answer,
read the inputs and perform the sub-calculations in any order,
safe in the knowledge that writing into the result matrix cannot
change the input matrix.
This freedom to choose the order can make a large difference for
heavily optimised algorithms.</p>
<p>But <code>restrict</code> is hardly discussed in the book
and appears only once in the index.
This is a real shame,
because we desparately need material to use
to train all the C programmers
on how to use <code>restrict</code> productively.
It's much better than using vendor-specific pragmas.
Even OpenMP ones.</p>
<h2>Fun with ints</h2>
<p>We love int types, right?</p>
<p>One of the fun things about C in the early days was that
integer types mapped fairly naturally to low-level machine quantities.
So on the Motorola 68000 CPU,
which had 32-bit registers and a 16-bit memory bus,
<code>int</code> was a 16-bit type, and <code>long</code> was a 32-bit type.</p>
<p>Then other people got their hands on C and there were many more
bizarre architectures with 37-bit types and tagged 42-bit types,
and no-one knew what any type was any more,
but we all knew that <code>int</code> was "obviously 32-bits"
on "any sensible machine",
except when it wasn't,
and a whole lot of code was simply unportable
to 64-bit UltraSPARC, 64-bit MIPS, or Digital ALPHA.</p>
<p>To fix this,
the wise owls invented <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>,
which was a way of getting an integer type that was exactly 32-bits,
or, if you were more relaxed about it,
an integer type that was at least 32-bits.</p>
<p><code>int_least32_t</code> has a nice ring to it don't you think?</p>
<p>Anyway, not enough programmers know about them,
and their good and profitable use
doesn't have enough discussion in the book.</p>
<h2>Designated Initialisers</h2>
<p>OMG how cool are <em>designated initialisers</em>.
We didn't even have these last time I wrote C,
and pretty much everything I know about them I got from reading
bits of the draft standard.</p>
<p>They are really useful in initialising structs where you don't
know the layout,
which happens when they're not your structs,
but you found them in someone else's header file.</p>
<p>Again, major new portability feature of C1999,
not discussed nearly enough in this book.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Recommended.
But not as your first C book.</p>
<p>Take a thick marker pen and strike out any section about
Traditional C.
You'll add a lot of black ink to the book,
but you'll avoid burning your eyes on ancient texts
that are not meant for mortals.</p>
