<h1>Unicode, the reading list</h1>
<time>2017-03-16</time>
<address>by David Jones</address>
<p>A few (good) Unicode articles have been going round recently.
I've gathered them and a couple of others here,
in a sort of reading list.
I've tried to put them into a recommended reading order.
Enjoy.</p>
<p>2003.
<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/">Spolsky's "The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer
Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character
Sets (No Excuses!)"</a>.
A classic.</p>
<p>2015?
<a href="http://kunststube.net/encoding/">Zentgraf's "What every programmer absolutely, positively needs
to know about encodings and character sets to work with text"</a>
offers quite a fundamental view and some reflections on PHP
(which I think should be entirely comprehesible to visitors from
other nearby lands).</p>
<p>2017.
<a href="http://reedbeta.com/blog/programmers-intro-to-unicode/">Reed's "A Programmer’s Introduction to Unicode"</a>
recently came round on Twitter and has
a lovely heatmap showing the areas of the Unicode space
that are used.
Also has an introduction to:
surrogate pairs, for 16-bit encodings; and,
combining marks, which create complex <em>grapheme clusters</em>.</p>
<p>2017.
<a href="http://blog.jonnew.com/posts/poo-dot-length-equals-two">New's "poo.length === 2"</a>. A modern Hacker News firefly.
Musings on the consequences of JavaScript using
an internal 16-bit encoding.
Share the descent into the rabbit hole of Emoji.</p>
<p>2016.
<a href="https://www.contentful.com/blog/2016/12/06/unicode-javascript-and-the-emoji-family/">Judis's "Emoji.prototype.length — a tale of characters in Unicode"</a>
builds a city in the Emoji rabbit hole.
You could spend your whole life here.</p>
