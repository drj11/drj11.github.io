A few (good) Unicode articles have been going round recently.
I've gathered them and a couple of others here,
in a sort of reading list.
I've tried to put them into a recommended reading order.
Enjoy.

2003.
[Spolsky's "The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer
Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character
Sets (No Excuses!)"](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/).
A classic.

2015?
[Zentgraf's "What every programmer absolutely, positively needs
to know about encodings and character sets to work with text"](http://kunststube.net/encoding/)
offers quite a fundamental view and some reflections on PHP
(which I think should be entirely comprehesible to visitors from
other nearby lands).

2017.
[Reed's "A Programmer’s Introduction to Unicode"](http://reedbeta.com/blog/programmers-intro-to-unicode/)
recently came round on Twitter and has
a lovely heatmap showing the areas of the Unicode space
that are used.
Also has an introduction to:
surrogate pairs, for 16-bit encodings; and,
combining marks, which create complex _grapheme clusters_.

2017.
[New's "poo.length === 2"](http://blog.jonnew.com/posts/poo-dot-length-equals-two). A modern Hacker News firefly.
Musings on the consequences of JavaScript using
an internal 16-bit encoding.
Share the descent into the rabbit hole of Emoji.

2016.
[Judis's "Emoji.prototype.length — a tale of characters in Unicode"](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2016/12/06/unicode-javascript-and-the-emoji-family/)
builds a city in the Emoji rabbit hole.
You could spend your whole life here.
