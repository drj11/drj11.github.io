<p>Brutalism in architecture, derived from the French <em>brut</em>
for <em>raw</em>, has the idea that structure should be exposed.
So it is with web design.</p>
<p><a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Websites like this</a>
are a satire.
But it is a satirical reaction to a real thing.</p>
<p>Obese websites.</p>
<p><a href="http://brutalistwebsites.com/">Someone has started a
collection of brutalist websites</a>.
The movement is small,
many may not recognise themselves as participating.
Some would call these minimalist rather than brutalist.
Some would call them brutal.</p>
