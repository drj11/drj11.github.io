<h1>Fast (Matrix) Exponentiation in R</h1>

<p>A few days ago,
Eric published
<a href="https://eric.netlify.com/2017/08/08/taking-powers-of-a-matrix-in-r/">the blog post titled "Taking powers of a matrix in R"</a>.
It's quite a nice post,
and certainly re-introduces me to some linear algebra which I
may have once known.
Who can say.</p>
<p>Let's say want to raise a matrix <em>M</em> to some power <em>k</em>
(exponentiation).
Because I got annoyed with unicode superscripts,
I'm going to use the notation <em>pow(M, k)</em> for this.</p>
<p>Eric's (cute) observation is that we can decompose a matrix <em>M</em>
into a diagonal form <em>PDP⁻¹</em>;
then <em>pow(M, k)</em> is <em>P(pow(D, k))P⁻¹</em>.
Since <em>D</em> is diagonal, it's far faster to exponentiate it than
a general matrix.</p>
<p>Eric discusses one drawback to this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>only better for large <em>n</em> (<em>n &gt; 80</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of other drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>complex arithmetic (for real or integer matrixes);</li>
<li>not exact for integer inputs;</li>
<li>not actually very fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fast way is repeated squaring.
To take an example:
<em>pow(M, 8)</em> is
M-squared-squared-squared.
Instead of 8 (or 7) multiplications,
we can use 3 squarings (which is 3 multiplications).</p>
<p>So, a bit more formally:</p>
<p><em>pow(M, 2*n)</em> is <em>square(pow(M, n))</em>;</p>
<p><em>pow(M, n+1)</em> is <em>M*pow(M, n)</em>.</p>
<p>This leads to a recursive scheme
to raise a matrix <em>M</em> to the <em>n</em>th power.
It has two recursive cases,
one when <em>n</em> is even (<em>n</em> is halved),
one when <em>n</em> is odd (<em>n</em> is reduced by one).
Both of these reduce <em>n</em>,
so eventually we hit the base case,
which is that <em>pow(M, 0)</em> is I.</p>
<p>In R code:</p>
<pre><code>pow_sq_recursive = function (A, k) {
  if(k == 0) {
    # identity
    diag(1, nrow(A))
  } else if(k %% 2 == 1) {
    A %*% pow_sq_recursive(A, k-1)
  } else {
    pow_sq_recursive(A %*% A, k %/% 2)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>(I couldn't avoid also writing the true iterative
version of this function,
see <a href="https://github.com/drj11/R-square-exponentiation">the github repo</a> for details)</p>
<p>I have shamelessly stolen Eric's code
to produce a retread of his lovely graph:</p>

<p>My favourite book,
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,
has a section on this algorithm in Chapter 1.</p>
