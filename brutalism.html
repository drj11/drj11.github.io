<h1>Brutalism in Web Design</h1>
<time>2016-05-25</time>
<address>by David Jones</address>
<p>Brutalism in architecture, derived from the French <em>brut</em>
for <em>raw</em>, has the idea that structure should be exposed.
So it is with web design.</p>

<p><a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Websites like this</a>
are a satire.
But it is a satirical reaction to a real thing.</p>
<p>Obese websites.</p>
<p><a href="http://brutalistwebsites.com/">Someone has started a
collection of brutalist websites</a>.
The movement is small,
many may not recognise themselves as participating.
Some would call these minimalist rather than brutalist.
Some would call them brutal.</p>
<h2>Inspiring Brutal</h2>
<p>Inspired by</p>
<ul>
<li>Brutalism; and,</li>
<li>The wave of "static site generators", Jekyll, Nikola, &amp;c; and,</li>
<li>Despicable dependencies (Nikola requires a C compiler, wtf!?)â€¦</li>
</ul>
<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/drj11/brutal">brutal</a>.
It's too stupid to do anything clever,
but it does convert <code>markdown</code> to <code>HTML</code>.
Mostly relying on the 3rd party Python library
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown">Markdown</a>.</p>
