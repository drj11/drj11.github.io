# drj11 blog

Hi drj11 from the future.

You're probably looking here because you've forgotten how to
build your blog.

It's written using `brutal` which drj11 also wrote.

You need to install `brutal` then run `make`.

To install `brutal` create a conda env
(which will have `setuptools`) and run `python setup.py install --user`.
