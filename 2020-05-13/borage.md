_Borago officinalis_

Borage is often regarded as a weed,
but I wanted some in our garden and we didn't have any.
Once established it is know to self-seed reliably and freely.
So the only problem is getting one.

Short version: Find a plant; dry it slowly over winter;
remove seeds; plant in spring indoors with ordinary potting compost.

At the end of last year while tidying up Mum's garden,
we pulled a mature Borage specimen and
stored the whole plant in a big paper sack in the greenhouse over winter.

Come spring the plant material was quite dry.
Over the course of a fairly tedious hour or so,
I got rid of all stalks and stuff, and concentrating on the bits
of the plant that hold seeds separated it three piles:
actual seeds; not seeds; bits of seed pod that are too hard for
me to get seeds out of that may or may not contain viable seeds.

Not knowing what to do for best results I hedged my bets.

Some of the seed I planted in pots in commercial potting compost,
thinly covered.
Kept moist and covered.

The rest of the seed went outside.
I found some poor soil
(probably soil from last years tomatoes or something like that),
made a small patch in our garden's wildflower area,
and sprinkled some seed on, and watered in.

The stuff that may or may or contain viable seeds got scattered
at random amongst various bits of the garden with no preparation.
