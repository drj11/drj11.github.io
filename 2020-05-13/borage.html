<h1>Planting Borage</h1>

<p><em>Borago officinalis</em></p>
<p>Borage is often regarded as a weed,
but I wanted some in our garden and we didn't have any.
Once established it is known to self-seed reliably and freely.
So the only problem is getting one.</p>
<p>Short version: Find a plant; dry it slowly over winter;
remove seeds; plant in spring indoors with ordinary potting compost.</p>
<p>At the end of last year while tidying up Mum's garden,
we pulled a mature Borage specimen and
stored the whole plant in a big paper sack in the greenhouse over winter.</p>
<p>Come spring the plant material was quite dry.
Over the course of a fairly tedious hour or so,
I got rid of all stalks and stuff, and concentrating on the bits
of the plant that hold seeds separated it three piles:
actual seeds; not seeds; bits of seed pod that are too hard for
me to get seeds out of that may or may not contain viable seeds.</p>

<p>Not knowing what to do for best results I hedged my bets.</p>
<p>Some of the seed I planted in pots in commercial potting compost,
thinly covered.
Kept moist and covered.</p>

<p>The rest of the seed went outside.
I found some poor soil
(probably soil from last years tomatoes or something like that),
made a small patch in our garden's wildflower area,
and sprinkled some seed on, and watered in.</p>
<p>The stuff that may or may or contain viable seeds got scattered
at random amongst various bits of the garden with no preparation.</p>
<h2>Key dates</h2>
<p>March 21 separated seed</p>
<p>March 22 planted</p>
<p>16 days after planting (April 7).  A sprout appears! Woohoo!
And a few days later a second one appears,
but I don't seem to have recorded when.</p>

<p>35 days after planting.
Imagine my surprise when more than 2 weeks after the first
sprout, another one appears!
I had given up on the other two pots.</p>

<p>41 days after planting (May 2).
Come the beginning of May I think the
first two are ready for planting out in the garden.
But a fourth sprout has appeared!</p>

<p>At some point at least a few of the seeds I planted outside
sprouted.
I can't remember when, and I didn't take a photo.</p>
<p>You can see from the most recent photo (below) that the Borage that
started in the greenhouse is far ahead of the seed that was
planted out:</p>

<p>In conclusion Borage can be grown from collected seed.
Better results if you plant it conventionally in a pot first,
but seemingly okay to scatter larger amounts on open ground.</p>
