In 2018 I joined Humanists UK.
With I suppose a slow dawning that I was, or might be, a
Humanist.
To be honest, I have little idea of what a Humanist is,
so why did I joined the society for Humanists?
Their campaigns.

When I look at what campaigns Humanists UK supported and what
policy changes they advocated, I find I agree with almost all of them.
For me, they have a much higher hit-rate than
other member organisations that I've joined.

I have their newsletter in front of me, where they announce that
Alice Roberts is appointed President of Humanists UK.
Professor Alice Roberts is brilliant and an outstanding
communicator and leader. Love it.

Summarising the campaigns mentioned in the newsletter, we find:

Recognition for humanists in places traditionally reserved for
the religious.
In particular in the National Service in
Whitehall (Humanists now included), and pastoral care (Humanists
UK is campaining to increase non-religious pastoral care in the
NHS and in prisons).

For education a general view that non-religious viewpoints are
as valid as religious ones. Prosecuting illegal faith schools,
widening Religious Education to include non-religious world
views, the admission of humanists into Standing Advisory
Councils for Religious Education, recommending that
collective worship in state-funded schools be abolished,
and ending religious discrimination in school admissions
(abolished in Ireland, but in England we're about to allow more
discrimination for academies).

A liberalisation of abortion law, and moving it from a criminal
procedure to a healthcare matter. Therefore, including it in sex
education, supporting the Lib Dem conference vote to
decriminalise abortion, supporting the Supreme Court's opinion
that Northern Ireland's abortion ban breaches human rights,
supporting the Isle of Man in decriminalising abortion, and
criticising Sajid Javid for abandoning an Isle-of-man-style
abortion clinic buffer-zone in the UK.

Supporting victims of blasphemy (in Pakistan and Spain in
particular), and supporting the decriminalisation of blasphemy
(still a crime Spain, Pakistan, Austria; recently decriminalised
in Ireland).

Also, Humanist Weddings. If you believe announcements made by
government.

Do you support some or most of these campaigns?
Maybe you're a humanist too.
