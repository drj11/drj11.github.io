It falls to me to write a review of Margaret Atwood’s novel
«The Handmaid’s Tale».

This is a work that has been
critiqued, criticised, prodded, poked, televised, revitalised,
sexualised; it has won famous awards and
sold millions of copies (although it seems curiously difficult to
find a reasonable count).
Why am i reviewing it?

I want to write about the last 14 pages. These pages struck me
with a punch when i first read it (around 2015 or so), and
still do when i re-read the book for this review.
I’ve had a few conversations
about the book since first reading it, and most
pay no attention to the final 14 pages.

There will be spoilers, of course, but probably no actual
spoilers of the element that most readers consider "the story".

To frame this review, i have to discuss the frame of the book,
and its layers (at least some of them).

The book is, on the surface, written from the first person
perspective of the narrator, a handmaid assigned the name Offred
by the state of Gilead.
Later in the story we find this isn’t quite true, as
the narrator admits herself that this is a reconstruction;
because it has to be.
In Gilead, the religious state in which the story takes place,
a handmaid has no access to the materials needed to write or record,
so the reconstruction is necessary.
The narrator herself also plays with her own narrative role, when
she sexes up a particular scene (and then admits her digression); and
also when she inserts the voice of her lost friend Moira, writing
Moira’s the best way she can.

For almost the whole book there is only one voice,
that of Offred.
Of course there are other actors, The Wife, The Commander, The
Shopping Companion, and so on, but we do not enter their
thoughts, we have only the thoughts of Offred;
the actions of the other actors are perceived through Offred.

In fact there are two other voices.
In the final 14 pages (it is 14 pages in the
mass-market paperback i am reading, your page count may vary),
the "action" shifts to an academic conference with an honourary keynote.
The host of the conference and the keynote speaker that they
introduce make up 2 more voices.

In the "main" story, Offred goes about her business in Gilead.
This is writ, as it were, as if on two translucent sheets:
one sheet covers her life in Gilead (the "now" of the story),
the other covers her previous life before the oppressive state of
Gilead was created.
This previous life is what readers would recognise as the "now",
or at least, the approximate now of the early 1980s.
Apparently there are enough details in the book to recognise
that the action takes places in present day Harvard and
its precinct.

In this previous life Offred had a husband and a daughter and a
bank account (and a name presumably, but we never know it).
In Gilead, Offred has none of these things, and
is raped by the state in service of a breeding program
controlled by elite males.

So there is the main story, and at end of it,
the final 14 pages, which is what i call the frame.
The frame is the academic conference, in which it is revealed
that the story we have just read, The Document, is a
transcription of events made from a voice recording.
This recording is the the reconstruction that Offred herself
refers to.
The voice recording is scattered across the
many (compact cassette) tapes found in an old buried box;
so there is a further reconstruction, by academic workers
referred to in the keynote, in order to assemble a coherent
narrative from the unordered tapes.

The "now" of the frame is the future, looking back at the story
(the "main" story) recorded on these tapes.
There are hints that the future in which the conference takes
place is not so far, but it is far enough that having to
reverse-engineer and build a tape deck that could play the tape
was A Thing.

So now we have The Story of Offred, as reconstructed by her,
recorded onto Many Tapes, buried and rediscovered,
transcribed and reassembled, discussed at an academic conference.

What does this shift say about the gentle reader? Our locus has
moved from the intimacy of Offred’s inner voice to the walnut
wattling of an academic lecture theatre.
Are we to suppose that we’re in the audience? We’re sitting
through the keynote?

The frame can be viewed as a lens. In the final 14 pages,
we are seeing the story through that lens, from the perspective of
a group of academics in the future.
Academics pondering about the
authenticity of the text, the tapes; they speculate, with reference
to archive material, about the identities of the people in the
story.

We see that the academics are a group concerned with Text,
Authenticity, Discourse.
As the academics look upon Gilead they make their
snide jokes about the quality of education in Other Places,
and asides about conference lunches.
Thus, as a group they are assured that even as brutal regimes come
and go, The Academy will remain.

Does that seem bad? Gilead, as we see through Offred’s lens, is
an inhumane and brutal regime. The state rapes, kills, tortures;
in the name of progress that will lead to fertility.
The academics, instead of confronting this brutality, seem
content to speculate about who Fred is, and how lucky they are
that English satellites recorded the transmissions of state
propaganda.

Setting the main story in North America is, i think, supposed to
anger us. How could such a thing happen to the great nation of
these United States?

But what about us in the audience? Are we complicit?
Does the book suggest that we are looking on
as nations slumber towards brutality?

The lens is a mirror.
Isn’t that exactly what we’re doing, right now?
