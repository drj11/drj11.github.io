<h1>Sunny Funny</h1>

<p>The story starts with 3 elements: An Acer netbook from 2008;
Haiku the implementation of BeOS (from the 1990s); and,
"cling wrap scanning", an ancient pixel tracing technique that
uses clear plastic stuck to the monitor.</p>
<p>I remembered i had a barely used Acer netbook in the attic.
It turned out to be an Acer ZG5 from 2008 with a 1.6GHz CPU,
1GB of RAM, and a 160GB rotating disk (this configuration
isn’t listed on Wikipedia, but whatever).</p>
<p>My Mastodon timeline has been showing me a few Haiku posts, and
i found it intriguing.
It's a reimplementation of BeOS, an operating system from the
1990s that was something of an obscure darling child.</p>
<p>My Mastodon timeline also showed me
<a href="https://typo.social/@nina_kali_nina@tech.lgbt/111456601630935995">this post from Nina Kalinina about "cling wrap
scanning"</a>.
Using a pen and clear plastic film, you take a copy of an
existing art.
Then put the plastic over the screen (with tape or the magic of
cling film) and use an image editor to copy the art with pixels.</p>
<p>So these things came together to form an idea for a project that
i might try: Install Haiku on the netbook and find some art
suitable for cling wrap scanning on it.</p>
<p>I had seen a few posts about people running Haiku
on this class of hardware.
After a false start of installing it on a partition which the
pre-existing grub couldn’t then boot into,
i installed it on the raw unpartitioned disk (i think).
Haiku runs reasonably well on the 2008 netbook, which is nice.
Maybe it could breathe some life into the old netbook.</p>
<p>A little exploration with Haiku reveals that doing ordinary web things is
a disaster, but loading BeOS websites from the early 2000s and
before works fine.</p>
<p>Haiku comes with WonderBrush, originally a for-money application
native to BeOS, but now distributed liberally.
I also tried to install ArtPaint, a more modern paint program,
but my initial efforts didn't work.
I think because there was no 32-bit version packaged.
But i did eventually install it later.</p>
<p>So what art could i "cling wrap scan"?
I start looking through my collection of videogame media, and
found...
This amazing poster from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaRappa_the_Rapper">PaRappa the
Rapper</a>.</p>
<p><img <="" alt="a printed poster showing, in cartoon style, all the
characters from PaRappa the Rapper" img="" src="../image/Sunny/PaRappaPosterSquare.jpg" style="max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100vh;" title="PaRappa the Rapper Poster"></p>
<p>On the back are the instructions and a picture of PaRappa on his
own.</p>
<p>I traced over PaRappa using actual clingfilm, and
it was terrible. It sticks okay onto the netbook though.
But the WonderBrush art program even in fullscreen only lets me
use a small portion of the total screen for the editing area.
I solved this problem by switching targets: Sunny Funny also
appears on the back, and the art is slightly narrower.
I traced over Sunny Funny instead, this time using a cut-open
ziploc bag from the ones that came with COVID-19 tests.
I had to tape the art sideways to fit it over the editable area in
WonderBrush.</p>
<p>Here's Sunny:</p>
<p><img <="" alt="Sunny Funny from the back of the poster, she's wearing a
blue and red dress" img="" src="../image/Sunny/SunnyPrint.jpg" style="max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100vh;" title="Sunny Funny"></p>
<p>What resolution? Something chunky and EGA compatible like 320×200 perhaps?
I traced using a 200×200 canvas at 200% (i think).</p>
<p><img <="" alt="Piece of clear plastic taped to the screen of the small
netbook. On the plastic is a drawing of Sunny Funny done with a
sharpie. Sideways." img="" src="../image/Sunny/SunnyTaped.jpg" style="max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100vh;" title="Sunny taped to my netbook"></p>
<p>Once i had basic outlines i removed the clear plastic with its
pen-drawn copy, and worked by mouse and eye.
WonderBrush isn’t really a true pixel editor, and even with the
"subpixel" box unchecked it would "half-shade" pixels when
i was using the freehand tool with the mouse.
Also my mouse skills are bad (possibly exacerbated by use an
authentic vintage mouse, and not a pro-gamer laserballs (the
trackpad was awful by the way)) and so
the actual shapes were not very accurate.</p>
<p><img <="" alt="Pixel image of my wobbly
version of Sunny Funny. Recognisably the familiar
anthropomorphic sunflower, but only in black and white, and
quite wobbly shapes" img="" src="../image/Sunny/Sunny200wobbly-rgb.png" style="max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100vh;" title="Wobbly Sunny"></p>
<p>Digital art and pixel editing is not something i've done before,
so it took me many many hours of single pixel cleaning and
reshaping to get this:</p>
<p><img <="" alt="Still in black and white, Sunny
has been cleaned up and most of the basic shapes are not so
wobbly" img="" src="../image/Sunny/Sunny200flat.png" style="max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100vh;" title="Flat Pixelly Sunny"></p>
<p>Nice. But needs rotating, right? Simples.</p>
<p>Aha, i can rotate in WonderBrush but... it resamples with some sort
of so-called <em>high-fidelity</em> cubic filter.
Which for bilevel pixel art is <strong>no bloody good</strong>.
Couldn’t work out how to fix that.
Seemingly can’t rotate in the image viewer.</p>
<p>Can install ImageMagick. Yes we can, but it seems not to work.
I also tried both installing and compiling from source
ArtPaint, but that didn’t work either (<code>git</code> works fine by the
way).</p>
<p>So, netpbm? Installs but doesn't work.</p>
<p>At some point while i was poking around i see that in
HaikuDepot, the package installer, it sometimes lists two
packages wih the same name (i think i added a repository at some
point).
For practical purposes we can call these two version "cursed"
and "uncursed".
I wondered if i could install the uncursed version of
ArtPaint, and i could!</p>
<p>ArtPaint <em>can</em> do the pixel-exact 90° rotation.
But i wasn't finding the pixel editing as comfortable as
WonderBrush, so i switched back to that for the rest of the
project.
Which by this point is filling with colour and drawing the
stripes on Sunny's dress.</p>
<p>Here shown with 3× pixels so that it appears reasonable, and
possibly without a blurring zoom, on modern displays.</p>
<p><img <="" alt="Sunny in colour, wearing a fetching
red and blue dress" img="" src="../image/Sunny/Sunnyx3ega.png" style="max-width: 100vw; max-height: 100vh;" title="Sunny in Colour"></p>
<p>I picked 200×200 partly so it fitted into an EGA display
(320×200), so it was natural to use the EGA palette.
However, i may have typed one or more of the palette entries
incorrectly (and see also subpixel problems below).</p>
<p>There is another problem with this idea of EGA art.
On actual EGA hardware the pixel aspect ratio is 1:1.2, whereas
i have square pixels.
This is only fixable by going back to the scanning step, and
using a pixel editor that can edit non-square pixels on a
square-pixel display.
I don't think that exists.</p>
<p>Filling in reveals some previously unfound subpixels
(pixels that are neither black nor transparent);
i fixed the ones i found, but it seems likely 
there might be a few remaining.
Probably i will fix this ultimately by writing some sort of
equality/difference tool in PyPNG.</p>
<p>Using ArtPaint and WonderBrush, i actually found them annoying
for the pixel work.
Though I would probably have different opinions if i was more familiar
with them.
Mainly the problem is that it was too fiddly to turn a single
pixel on or off.
It's easy enough in WonderBrush to turn a single pixel on, but
turning it off either involves <em>moving the mouse</em> to select
a new palette entry or right clicking to change the tool.
The scrollwheel could be used to zoom, but
only zoomed around the canvas centre, not where the mouse is
pointing (although it did only stop at integer zooms, which was
useful for this work; unlike ArtPaint).</p>
<p>ArtPaint had slightly different issues, but similar in scope.</p>
<p>For many pixels applications, a <em>true full screen</em> mode would be useful.
Nina Kalinina wrote a quick-and-dirty homegrown pixel editor in
QBasic when she was doing this.
And it makes a lot of sense to me. I was tempted.</p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Overall i enjoyed the project.
It was nice to install an OS on the netbook that it could
plausibly run.
It was nice to have an excuse to poke around with Haiku/BeOS a bit.
And it was nice to try the lo-tech lo-fi "scanning".</p>
<p>And of course, retro sunflower girl from an iconic 1990s
videogame, what's not to like about that?</p>
