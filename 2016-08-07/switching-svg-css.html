<h1>Switching CSS in SVG</h1>
<time>2016-08-07</time>

<p>SVG, stands for Scalable Vector Graphics,
is a way of making graphics from lines and curves and stuff
(as opposed to pixels, which is how JPEG and PNG and things work).</p>
<p>It's great.
I use Inkscape to maintain a scale drawing of my back garden in SVG:</p>
<p><img src="https://drj11.github.io/house/rear-garden.svg"></p>
<p>That version is in colour.</p>
<p>For planning the garden,
i like to
print out the scale drawing
and draw on it with pen and pencil.
But for that, a black and white outline is more useful.</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to define a second CSS stylesheet,
and switch between the two.
Fun fact: you can style SVG using CSS, just like you can HTML.
Fun fun fact: this works because HTML and SVG are both XML based.</p>
<p>I didn't find a good way to do this, but I did find a way.</p>
<p>I can create an HTML page
which includes the SVG via an <code>OBJECT</code> tag.
I can then run some JavaScript
which fetches the DOM on the SVG object
and modifies the SVG to add a <code>style</code> element.</p>
<p><a href="https://drj11.github.io/house/rear-garden-outline.html">Here is the vector outline
version</a>.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is technically quite an obscure corner of the web.
I suspect that there are better approaches.
If you find one, please write it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC).
You sometimes see a flash of colour,
which is actually the original syle,
not unstyled content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HTML document and the SVG each have DOMs,
and they are separate.
In particular, adding style to the HTML document
does not style the SVG document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SVG really is XML, so when adding a <code>style</code> tag,
you have to get the case right, and the namespace right.</p>
</li>
</ul>
